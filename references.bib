  abstract = {The quantum Hall effect is universal and expected to occur in all two-dimensional electron systems in perpendicular high-magnetic field. We revisit quantum localization thanks to the high-energy scale of the quantum Hall effect in graphene, where the electron dynamics obey the Dirac equation. We solve a long debated question on the nature of electron transport in the transition region between Hall resistance plateaus. Is it of metallic or of variable-range hopping type as proposed, respectively, by Pruisken and Polyakov-Shklovskii? To the best of our knowledge, no experiment was able to discriminate between these models. Here, measurements of the conductance peak width scaling exponents with both temperature and current and determination of the localization length validates the variable-range hopping scenario. This shows that the usual assumption of a metallic behavior of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) between Hall resistance plateaus is unnecessary for macroscopic samples.},

  abstract = {We introduce the problem of *shadow tomography*: given an unknown D-dimensional quantum mixed state ρ, as well as known two-outcome measurements E1,…,{EM}, estimate the probability that Ei accepts ρ, to within additive error ε, for each of the M measurements. How many copies of ρ are needed to achieve this, with high probability? Surprisingly, we give a procedure that solves the problem by measuring only O( ε−5·log4 M·{logD}) copies. This means, for example, that we can learn the behavior of an arbitrary n-qubit state, on *all* accepting/rejecting circuits of some fixed polynomial size, by measuring only {nO}( 1) copies of the state. This resolves an open problem of the author, which arose from his work on private-key quantum money schemes, but which also has applications to quantum copy-protected software, quantum advice, and quantum one-way communication. Recently, building on this work, Brandão et al. have given a different approach to shadow tomography using semidefinite programming, which achieves a savings in computation time.},

  abstract = {Randomized numerical linear algebra - {RandNLA}, for short - concerns the use of randomization as a resource to develop improved algorithms for large-scale linear algebra computations. The origins of contemporary {RandNLA} lay in theoretical computer science, where it blossomed from a simple idea: randomization provides an avenue for computing approximate solutions to linear algebra problems more efficiently than deterministic algorithms. This idea proved fruitful in the development of scalable algorithms for machine learning and statistical data analysis applications. However, {RandNLA}'s true potential only came into focus upon integration with the fields of numerical analysis and "classical" numerical linear algebra. Through the efforts of many individuals, randomized algorithms have been developed that provide full control over the accuracy of their solutions and that can be every bit as reliable as algorithms that might be found in libraries such as {LAPACK}. Recent years have even seen the incorporation of certain {RandNLA} methods into {MATLAB}, the {NAG} Library, {NVIDIA}'s {cuSOLVER}, and {SciKit}-Learn. For all its success, we believe that {RandNLA} has yet to realize its full potential. In particular, we believe the scientific community stands to benefit significantly from suitably defined "{RandBLAS}" and "{RandLAPACK}" libraries, to serve as standards conceptually analogous to {BLAS} and {LAPACK}. This 200-page monograph represents a step toward defining such standards. In it, we cover topics spanning basic sketching, least squares and optimization, low-rank approximation, full matrix decompositions, leverage score sampling, and sketching data with tensor product structures (among others). Much of the provided pseudo-code has been tested via publicly available {MATLAB} and Python implementations.}
