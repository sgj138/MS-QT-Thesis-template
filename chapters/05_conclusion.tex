State the result clearly and without ambiguity. Refer to figures/tables using Fig.~\ref{fig:example} if in the middle of sentence or Figure~\ref{fig:example} if at the start of a sentence.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.78\textwidth]{figures/example_figure.pdf}
  \caption{Example figure caption. Axis labels, tick labels, and plot titles must be
  legible and comparable in size to the caption text.\label{fig:example}}
\end{figure}
