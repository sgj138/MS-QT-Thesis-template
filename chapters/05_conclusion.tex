State the result clearly and early. Refer to following summary figures/tables using \cref{fig:example}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.78\textwidth]{figures/example_figure.pdf}
  \caption{Example figure caption. Axis labels, tick labels, and plot titles must be
  legible and comparable in size to the caption text.}
  \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}


Therefore we can conclusively say that A is True but conditional on B.
